# Code Ride Repeat - A small little Blog
### ... mainly build to learn coding ;) 

## Stack
- Contentful
- Next.js
- Material UI
- Sass

## What I learned
- Using an (Contentful) API.
- Not to use an personal API-Key in Frontend.
    - in react `.env-File + REACT_APP_[Your Const Name]` is a solution, but dangerous (it's a Frontend App)
    - idealy pas the API-Requests with personal Keys to a backendapp and run them on the server
- that ServerSideRendering is a cool thing to do, especially for pushing SEO and Performance.
- how the built in next-routing works.
- to host a Next-App on vercel.com
- Comining MUI with Next (Problems with Link-Modules avoided)
- Launching an Next.js-App with [vercel](https://vercel.com) is my option (because I dont't have any server, only a hosting package and a bunch of domains)
